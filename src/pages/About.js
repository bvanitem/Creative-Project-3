        <h2>Our mission here at Go Green is to raise awareness and help those who do not know how to reduce their 
            effect on the world start doing so! We take pride in the world around us and want to make sure that all
            people unite to save the earth.</h2>

        <h1>Why Go Green</h1>
        <p>Our community is full of environmental diversity and natural beauty, but unfortunately as the years have passed, our community has started to become
         bogged down. While part of the problem is ignorance, we know that there are so many people who want to make a difference.
         At Go Green we have cerified ecologists, biologists and social leaders that help us provide education and meaningful opportunities for
         people to get involved, and do their part to save the earth.</p>
